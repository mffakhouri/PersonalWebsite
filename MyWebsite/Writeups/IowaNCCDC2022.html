    <blockquote>
        Iowa State University invited surrounding Universities to a national Cyber Defense Competition that they host every
        year. The purpose of this competition is to provide students with a simulation of real-life experiences in Information
        Assurance for the purpose of education. Students play the role of the Blue Team (or, the Information Assurance
        community), under the influence of an active Red Team (users simulating threat actors). Teams are scored on a 
        variety of factors, including: documentation, network usability/integrity, and service uptime.

        Iowa NCCDC was the first experience I had in terms of CCDC. This year, I was given the opportunity to lead DePaul's JV team. We ended
        third among teams of all skill levels nationally, which was really exciting to see given the team's inexperience. Here is a collective writeup of 
        our findings throughout the competition.
