        Here is a cumulative writeup of the flags my team and I were able to acquire during the MetaCTF competition.
        This year, I lead the team "Through The Wire" alongside my teammates George, Yusuf, and Jim.
        It was a collective first time competing in MetaCTF and I'm incredibly happy with what we were able
        to find.
