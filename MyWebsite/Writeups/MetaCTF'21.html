        MetaCTF creates interactive and educational capture the flag (CTF) events that make it easy to learn and understand
        cybersecurity skills broken down into several concepts. The team creates engaging challenges simulating real
        world scenarios in their competitions held every year.

        Here is a cumulative writeup of the flags my team and I were able to acquire during the MetaCTF competition.
        This year, I lead the team "Through The Wire" alongside my teammates George, Yusuf, and Jim.
        We all had a great time competing this year and we were very impressed with how fun and educational 
        the questions were. Thank you to MetaCTF and thank you to my teammates for a great competition!
    </p></center>
