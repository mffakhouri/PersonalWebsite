        This repo will hold a collection of security scripts that some fellow peers and I are actively contributing to. These scripts are made with the
        intention of learning the fundamentals of bash scripting and the proper baselining of linux systems.

    <p>
        <code>usermng.py</code> - A python script that is able to take a list of authorized users (either entered manually or through a text document)
        and list discrepancies in comparison to the /etc/passwd file.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>AIF.sh</code> - A shell script that I contributed to YES (Yorge's Enumeration Script) that establishes basic system information
        inspired by the Security Daemon's Asset Inventory inject. Such information includes system name, O/S and version, intenal/external addresses, 
        list of accounts, list of services running, and list of open ports.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>PassPol.sh</code> - A shell script the simplifies the addition of password policies that utilizes libpam-pwquality. This includes
        complexity requirements, length minimum, and failed attempt penalities. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>mysqlbackup.sh</code> - A shell script that performs a full backup of current MySql databases and saves them to a desired directory.
