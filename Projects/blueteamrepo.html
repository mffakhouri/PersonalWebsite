        This repo will hold a collection of security scripts that some fellow peers and I are actively contributing to. These scripts are made with the
        intention of learning and understanding the fundamentals of bash scripting along with their applications to cybersecurity. 
    </p>

    <p>Some of my current projects include:</p>
    <p>
        <code>iptablesmenu.sh</code> - A shell program that can automatically apply iptables rules for incoming/outgoing connections based on 
        open ports. It also automates some features of iptables, such as saving/loading rules, listing rules, establishing logging, and accepting/dropping all 
        incoming packets.
    </p>

    <p><code>usermng.py</code> - A python script that is able to take a list of authorized users (either entered manually or through a text document)
    and list discrepancies in comparison to the /etc/passwd file.
    </p>

    <p><code>AIF.sh</code> - A shell script that I contributed to YES (Yorge's Enumeration Script) that establishes basic system information
        inspired by the Security Daemon's Asset Inventory inject. Such information includes system name, O/S and version, intenal/external addresses, 
        list of accounts, list of services running, and list of open ports.
    </p>

    <p><code>PassPol.sh</code> - A shell script the simplifies the addition of password policies that utilizes libpam-pwquality. This includes
        complexity requirements, length minimum, and failed attempt penalities.
