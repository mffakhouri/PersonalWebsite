        This repo will hold a collection of security scripts that myself and some of my fellow peers are contributing to. These scripts are made with the
        intention of learning and understanding the fundamentals of bash scripting along with their applications to cybersecurity. 
    </p>

    <p>Some of my current projects include:</p>
    <p>
        <code>iptablesmenu.sh</code> - A shell program that can automatically apply iptables rules for incoming/outgoing connections based on 
        open ports. It also automates some features of iptables, such as saving/loading rules, listing rules, establishing logging, and accepting/dropping all 
        incoming packets.
    </p>

    <p><code>usermng.py</code> - A python script that is able to take a list of authorized users (either entered manually or through a text document)
    and compare them to users listed on /etc/passwd. It will then give the discrepancies between the two.
    </p>

    <p><code>AIF.sh</code> - A shell script that I contributed to YES (Yorge's Enumeration Script) that establishes basic system information
        inspired by the Security Daemon's Asset Inventory Inject. Such information includes system name, o/s and version, ip addresses, 
        list of accounts, list of services running, and list of open ports.
    </p>

    <p><code>PassPol.sh</code> - A shell script the simplifies the addition of password policies that utilizes libpam-pwquality. This includes
        complexity requirements, length minimum, and failed attempt penalities. 
    
    </p>

    <p> Also have current plans of making a script that establishes a security checklist onto a newly installed system. WIP for now.</p>
