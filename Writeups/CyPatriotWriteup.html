    <p class=desc> AFA's Cyberpatriot is a youth cyber program intended to inspire students toward careers in cybersecurity. It is the largest cyberdefense competition that puts high school and middle school students in charge of securing networks.</p>
    
    <p class=desc>This particular writeup will not have as much of a technical analysis as others purely because it is being written almost a year and a half after the competition occurred. This was also my very first cybersecurity competition, so my knowledge was incredibly limited and I had much to learn.</p>

    <p> <span>Cyberpatriot 2019</span></p>

    <p> During my senior year of highschool, my college cybersecurity teacher gave us the opportunity to participate in the Air Force Association's 
        Cyberpatriot. Knowing very little about any sort of networking or blue teaming methods, I had much to learn and discover during this competition.</p>

    <p> The general idea of the competition is that teams are given three virtual machines, one quiz, and one follow-up cisco packet-tracer file. On 
        the virtual machines (one linux, one windows, and one windows server), students were assigned to assess vulnerabilities,  
        misconfigurations, processes being ran. I was, however, responsible for the cisco quiz and packet tracer assignment. For the quiz,
        we were given complicated networking questions that were given in a multiple choice answer format. For the packet tracer assignment, we were responsible for configuring a 
        pre-existing network in accordance to a blueprint given to us. This blueprint involved a mock network environment that needed to be configured according to 
        some ruleset.</p>

    <p> The entire competition was broken into five separate rounds, each competition progressively getting harder based on your teams score on
         the first two rounds. These first two rounds were pretty forgiving, given my incredible lack of networking experience. I was able to search
          online and learn the content for both the quiz and packet tracer file, and as a result, got most of the points possible for my team. The third 
          competition, however, was a bit of a disaster.</p>

    <p> Since our team did so well in the first two rounds of the competition, we were placed in the platinum division for the third round (aka with the big dogs).
         For this round, our problems given to us were significantly harder. The questions given to me on the quiz were completely out of the scope of a google search,
          and as a result, I did poorly on it.  </p>

    <p>Likewise, the packet tracer file I was responsible to manage and secure was out the scope of my knowledge as well.
         I was given the responsibility of configuring a small towns network connection in accordance to the way it was directed to me.
          As I said earlier, I had no prior networking experience to this competition, and thus, I scored very low on the packet tracer file</p>

    <p> Overall, the competition was a fun learning experience. It was exciting to see what a beginner-friendly competition had to offer in the world of cybersecurity, 
        and it definitely influenced my decision to become a major in cybersecurity. Some key takeaways that come to mind include studying for potential content during the 
        competition. Although this seems incredibly obvious, senior year me was confident in my ability to learn on the spot. I should have, at the bare minimum, became more
         familiar with Cisco's Packet tracer. Not only would this have allowed me to better configure the hosts and networking devices in the subnet, but also it would have 
         potentially given me some knowledge to score better on the quiz. </p>

    <p> It was the second year the competition was held for our school, and our team did the best out of any up to that point. I hope my experience,
         along with my teammates, can help pave the way and loosen out the quarks for the underclassmen at my highschool to score and succeed better in the Cyberpatriot competition.</p>
