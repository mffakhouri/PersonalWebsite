        AFA's Cyberpatriot is a youth cyber program intended to inspire students toward careers in cybersecurity. It is the largest cyberdefense 
        competition that puts high school and middle school students in charge of securing networks.

        This particular writeup will not have as much of a technical analysis as others purely because it is being written almost a year and a half after
        the competition occurred. This was also my very first cybersecurity competition, so my knowledge was incredibly limited and I had much to learn.

    <p class=test> 
        During my senior year of highschool, my college cybersecurity teacher gave us the opportunity to participate in the Air Force Association's 
        Cyberpatriot. Knowing very little about any sort of networking or blue teaming methods, I had much to learn and discover during this competition.
    </p>

    <p> 
        The general idea of the competition is that teams are given three virtual machines, one quiz, and one follow-up cisco packet-tracer file. On 
        the virtual machines (one linux, one windows, and one windows server), students were assigned to assess vulnerabilities,  
        misconfigurations, and processes being ran. I was, however, responsible for the cisco quiz and packet tracer assignment. For the quiz,
        we were given complicated networking questions that were given in a multiple choice answer format. For the packet tracer assignment, we were 
        responsible for configuring a pre-existing network in accordance to a blueprint given to us. This blueprint involved a mock network environment 
        that needed to be configured according to a given rule set.
    </p>

    <p> 
        The entire competition was broken into five separate rounds, each competition progressively getting harder based on teams scores during
        the first two rounds. These first two rounds were pretty forgiving, given my incredible lack of networking experience. Most of the content
        given to me was rather beginner friendly. Some of the tasks I completed on during these rounds on the Packet Tracer file include assigning 
        IP addresses to devices, assigning secret passwords to the network devices, and establishing basic VLANS within the network along with adequate
        permissions among them.
    </p>

    <p> 
        My teammates did very well during these first two rounds, achieving most points on the windows server, linux, and windows boxes. Since our team did 
        so well in the first two rounds of the competition, we were placed in the platinum division for the third round (aka with the big dogs). 
        This meant we were at the top 30% of all competitors in the entirety of the competition, which was exciting.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this round, though, the problems given to us were significantly 
        harder. The questions I had on the quiz were completely out of the scope of my knowledge, and as a result, I did poorly on it.  
        Likewise, the Packet Tracer file I was responsible to manage and secure was out the scope of any beginner networking concepts I was aware of. 
        For it, I was given the responsibility of configuring a small towns network connection in accordance to a certain ruleset.
        As I mentioned earlier, I had no prior networking experience to this competition, and thus, I scored very low on the Packet Tracer file. We were
        knocked out after the third stage of the competition.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Overall, the competition was a fun learning experience. It was exciting to see what a beginner-friendly competition had to offer in the world of 
        cybersecurity, and it definitely influenced my decision to major in in it. Some key takeaways that come to mind include studying
        for potential content before the competition. Although this seems incredibly obvious, senior year me was confident in my ability to learn on the 
        spot. I should have, at the bare minimum, become more familiar with Cisco's Packet Tracer. 
    </p>

    <p> 
        It was the second year the competition was held for our school, and our team did the best out of any up to that point. I hope my teams 
        experience can help pave the way and loosen out the quarks for the underclassmen at my highschool to succeed and score higher than we did.
    </p>

    <p> 
        I also want to give a huge thank you to my teammates: George, Aiden, Bobby, Jack, and JJ for their hard work and dedication to the competition.
