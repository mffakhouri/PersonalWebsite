    <p class=design > 
        Another year, another round of Hivestorm. This year, I was a member of Team 007 with my teamates Anna, Petar, and Mary. Here was out score
        report at the end of the competition:

    <br>
    <p> 
        This year I was mainly on the Ubuntu 18 machine with some activity on the Debian 9 machine. Ubuntu 18 had Samba as a critical service and 
        Debian 9 had Postgres as a critical service.

        Here are some of the highlights of this year:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> {Team total point count of 151}</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> {21st place out of over 200 other collegiate-level teams}</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> {1st place out of a total of 7 teams competing at my university}</b>
    </p>


    <br>
    <p><span> Time management </span></p>
    <br>
    <p> 
        In general, I am proud about the way I managed my time this year in comparison to year's competition. First of all, no hiccups were had in 
        terms of technology. The web-based virtual machine worked fine the entire duration of the competition. Also, this year
        teams were given only four boxes instead of last years five, which relieved the stress of managing multiple boxes with the four player 
        team limit. 
        </p>
    <p>
        My score progress was consistent throughout the entire four-hour time slot given to us, with only a drought of points on my machine toward
        the end of the competition. I spent about 30-45 minutes on the first three forensic questions given to players on each machine (CTF style 
        questions) and spent the rest on OS/service hardening.

    <br>
    <p> 
        For the last 40-50 minutes, I swapped Linux boxes with my teammate and we tried to find any easy points either us of might
        have missed. I was able to only scrap a single point on the Debian box (which funnily enough bumped us past a few teams that 
        got 150 points).
    </p>

    <br>
    <p><span> What worked </span></p>
    <br>

    <p>
        Forensic questions this year were primarily CTF based. I was able to get 1/3 of them during the competition but was unable to figure 
        out the other two until after.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Forensic Question 1</b> dealt with finding a perl backdoor installed on the host that was able to connected to using netstat.
        I wasn't able to figure out this question during the competition primarily because I didn't find any backdoor information when 
        looking into running processes with <code>ps aux</code>. The key piece of info I missed was the installation of a malicious program 
        called "unhide", which hid the process from the query I was trying. Props to Anna for figuring this out after the competition.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Forensic Question 2</b> needed to check which users were configured with the smb share called "skyshare" that was associated with the samba config 
        file. I skimmed through the config file and tested several things I thought would work within the file. Nothing ended up working.
        Since I was not at all familiar with samba, I skipped this question to save some time after a few failed attempts. I didn't end up getting this one,
         but figured out later that I needed to use the sambapasswd utility in order to find these users.
    </p> 

    <p> 
        <b>Forensic Question 3</b> required the review of samba log activity from a host named "tamriel". Going into <code>/var/log</code> and checking 
        the samba log file, I was able to easily retrieve this info. Note that grep is very useful in the instance of going through log files, which
        may contain hundreds of logs that you would otherwise have to look through manually.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Now, OS/service hardening:</b> </p>

    <p> A lot of this section's points were broken up into a few subsections: user adjustments, updates, password policies, network security,
        and the removal of programs/processes not critical to the host.</p>

    <p> Fixing user permissions and removing evil users all got me a decent amount of points. This included ensuring users
        had proper roles in accordance to the README file (which contains the rules and best practices for the box) and removing users that 
        aren't authorized. <code>/etc/passwd</code> is very useful for checking unauthorized users because going through the user
        management application built into Ubuntu by default may not show hidden users. Sadly, this is a
        little time costly since the README is a picture instead of a text file and you can't enter the list of users into a script. Also, while we 
        are in this this file, it is good to check the login shells for programs and ensure that they do not have it set to <code>/bin/bash</code> 
        or <code>/bin/sh</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Outside of this config file, the default Ubuntu user management program is good for getting the rest of the points associating with managing users. 
        Going back into the settings from this management page provides a good opportunity to transition into updating the system. Typically, setting
        up daily updates and improving the security standard of updates is a good practice. Updating and upgrading all programs and the kernal,
         however, can be dangerous in terms of time cost. Updating core programs is far more efficient and time effective, so, updating samba and 
        firefox individually got me some points.
    </p>

    <p> Password policy adjustments were another bulk of my total points. This involved installing libpam-pwquality and adding some commands
        into the pam module that handles password complexity. Also, editing the <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and establishing minimum and maximum
        password ages got me some points.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Network security mostly involved editing the <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file. I pre-wrote a script to edit this file with many different 
        network commands targeting ip traffic, which got me a few points. Also, enabling ufw (default firewall) also netted me points. I thought
        netstat would be useful for gathering network information and killing unnecessary connections, but I didn't end up finding anything.
    </p>

    <p> 
        <code>ps aux</code> is very useful for finding processes that are useless or harmful to the host. Closing these will, most of the time,
        get you some points. Also, looking through all the files in the computer through the find command is useful for finding prohibited files. 
        Querying by .mp4, .mp3, .exe, etc are a few examples.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p><span>Retrospectives</span></p>
    <br>
    <p> 
        In my writeup for Hivestorm last year, I mentioned that I needed to prepare to see the unexpected during these types of competitions. I really
        didn't expect to see samba as an essential service for my machine, which really threw me off. Googling through samba's best practices and 
        configurations in terms of security really ate up a lot of my time. For next year, I feel that focussing primarily on OS security/hardening
        will be the best approach because you can never really predict what the essential service will be. 
    </p>

    <p> 
        Scripting proved to be useful this competition in terms of editing the config files. You can't really utilize a user authorization script 
        since the README is an image. I did not end up using a general script for everything this year out of a fear of breaking everything 
        on the system. If I properly test scripts for linux systems and dive deeper into OS security, I will have a lot more time 
        to look into the essential service given to me.
    </p>

    <p> Finally, I believe that practicing more CTF style questions will always prove to be useful, especially for those forensic questions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Overall, I'm pretty happy with how this competition went in comparison to last year. I ended up finding a lot more vulnerabilities
        and the scripts I used proved to be useful. Almost everything went according to plan. My teammates also did very well and I am happy with our
        communication and everyone's performance. Thank you to my teammates and I'm looking forward to next year!
