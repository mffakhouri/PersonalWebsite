        <blockquote> Hivestorm is a collegiate cyber defense competition where teams secure Linux and Windows based virtual machines.
        Some examples of vulnerability mitigation include removing malware, correcting misconfigurations, and disabling vulnerable services. 
        Teams accumulate points for each issue addressed.</blockquote>

    <p><span> Overview </span> </p>

    <br>
    <p class=design > 
        During Hivestorm, I was a member of team069 with my incredible teammates: George, Yusuf, and Dorian. 
         Here was out final score chart at the the end of the competition.

    <p> 
        During this competition, I spent most of my time the Ubuntu 16 box. The score for each box is given out of 100 points, so I finished with
        a final score of 14 during the time slot. In comparison to other teams: the top linux boxes this year scored around 60 - 75 points and the average
        total team score was around 100.

        Unfortunately, I made two major errors during the competition that costed me a lot of the time given to me. For the competition, 
        we were alloted a four hour time slot, and these mistakes took a hefty toll on my final score.

    <br>
    <p> 
        The red line reflects my progression during the competition. As one can see, I had a lot of pitfalls and comebacks, and this was the result of me 
        updating my virtual box. During our practice image given to us before the competition, executing a <code>sudo apt-get update || sudo apt-get
        upgrade</code> gave us a several points for updating essential programs. The problem during the actual competition, however, was that there were 
        so many available packages and installations to the point where it was taking up a lot more time than I initially anticipated it to the early stages.
    </p>

    <p> 
        At the end of the update, I was prompted to restart the computer. This restart completely bricked my computer, and I had to start all over.
        This occurred around the 17:20 mark.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along with this, the web based virtual machine I was using was being incredibly dysfunctional. Not only was it moving incredibly slow, but my 
        keystrokes were being duplicated frequently. This was my second major time loss, and I had to refer to the Hivestorm white team on their discord.
        The solution was installing VMWare on my computer, which ran the virtual machine miles more efficiently.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p><span> What worked </span></p>
    <br>
    <p> 
        Although updating every single package on the machine lost me a ton of time, I ended up getting some points for updating essential processes.
        Some packages that successfully updated include firefox, nginx, and php, which all netted me some points.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Going through the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, I was able to identify unauthorized users and remove them accordingly. Similarly, I went through 
        the <code>/etc/groups</code> file in order to filter out users that had misconfigured privileges.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Reconfiguring passwords was another essential step needed for points. I found certain users with insecure passwords (e.g less than 8 chars, no
        capitals/numbers/special chars) and changed them accordingly. 
    </p>

    <p> 
        Killing unauthorized/unnecessary processes was another small piece of my total score. Running a <code>netstat -plunt</code>
        and comparing necessary processes being ran to the list given was sufficient for points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Disallowing guest users was also needed, and this was done by configuring the <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> file.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p><span>Retrospectives</span></p>
    <br>
    <p> 
        One big takeaway that could have saved me a lot of hassle is to update individual packages rather than updating every single package
        on the virtual machine. We are given a list of essential/necessary applications for each box, so if I update these packages individually, I will
        most likely save a lot more time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The difficulty of the practice image was also not at all similar in comparison to the actual image I was given. I ended up getting around 75-85% of all 
        the content on this practice image, which gave me a false sense of confidence entering the competition. In a situation where I am unfamiliar with the actual 
        competition, I should be expected to prepare for anything thrown at me. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        Installing VMWare was also a huge time loss for me as mentioned earlier. I don't really know how I could have avoided this, as multiple other 
        students were also sharing the same problem to the white team. At least, now I know that VMWare is an excellent program for running
        virtual machines. As a matter of fact, this problem gave me experience in contacting the white team during a competition format, which could be 
        an essential step to repairing an issue in future competitions.

    </p>

    <p>
        Now that I have also practiced bash scripting, I may be able to automate some practices during the competition in a more efficient manner. This 
        can possibly include searching for unauthorized users automatically (something I made already on my github), or an all in one set up script for 
        the vulnerabilities we know for sure we will need to fix (something I might make soon). It may also be worth it to look into Windows security,
        since I did not touch any of the windows boxes nor know what to look out for on their systems. Possibly something to keep in mind during team 
        consolation and time management with each box.
    </p>

    <p> 
        One common theme among most of the problems I faced  were that I never anticipated for any of them. I assumed everything would work 
        ahead of time, which appears to be a problematic mindset. I should expect to see broken aspects of anything during these competitions
        and adapt accordingly in a reasonable amount of time.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        There were a lot of key takeaways from this competition. It taught me a lot about the necessity of preparation behind a competition. If there is a
        Hivestorm hosted in 2021, I will be a whole lot more prepared to crush this years score. Thank you to the CIAS for hosting the 
        competition as well! Also a huge thank you to the members on my team, as they helped me around during the competition and I wouldn't have
        learned as much without them.
